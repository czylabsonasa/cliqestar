\begin{block}{Clustering coefficient}
\small
  The local clustering coefficient of a node $v$, is a proportion of connected vertex pairs among all possible pairs from the neighbourhood of $v$. Its exact computations are basically triangle counting methods see \cite{Lat}. We implemented an $O(|V|maxdeg^{2})$ algorithm.
