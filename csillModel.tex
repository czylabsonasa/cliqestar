\begin{block}{The N-star model}\small
  
  It is a centralized variant of the $N$-clique model: at each step a (possibly new) vertex and $N-1$ old vertices interact forming an $N$-star, i.e an $N$-tree with a central vertex and $N-1$ leaves.
  The process of the evolution is as follows: Start with an $N$-star, with weigths one all of its substars. At each step $N$ vertices interact. W.p. $p$ add a new vertex $v$ to the graph and select an $N-1$ element set $K$ from the old vertices: w.p. $r$ from the $N-1$ stars proportional to their weights or w.p. $1-r$ from the existing vertices uniformly, then set $K=K\cup{v}$. W.p. $1-p$ select $N$ element set $K$ from the old vertices: w.p. $q$ select from the $N$ stars proportional to their weights or w.p. $1-q$ from the existing vertices uniformly.  Note that if no central node in $K$ ($(p,1-r)$ and $(1-p,1-q)$ branches) select it uniformly from the {\small\it old} vertices of $K$. At last add the $N$-star generated by $K$ to the graph and increase all of its subcliques weights by one.
