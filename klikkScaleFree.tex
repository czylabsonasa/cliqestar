\begin{block}{Scale-free property}
\small
In \cite{BaMo} the authors proved the scale free property in case of $N=3$, for 
the weight of vertices and for the degree, in \cite{FaPo} the same was proved for 
$N\ge 3.$ We generated some instances of the $N$-clique model for $N=3,4$ with stepsize 
$10^7$. In the following figures the theoretical "power-law" lines are intentionally omited, 
to make easier the pictorial comparison with the $N$.star model.
